[SB 3.28.18](https://vedabase.io/en/library/sb/3/28/18/)
```
  kīrtanya-tīrtha-yaśasaṁ
  puṇya-śloka-yaśaskaram
  dhyāyed devaṁ samagrāṅgaṁ
  yāvan na cyavate manaḥ
```
  - The glory of the Lord is always worth singing, for His glories enhance the glories of His devotees. One should therefore meditate upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead and upon His devotees. One should meditate on the eternal form of the Lord until the mind becomes fixed.
  - Another significant word in this verse is puṇya-śloka-yaśaskaram. The devotee is called puṇya-śloka. As one becomes purified by chanting the holy name of the Lord, so one can become purified simply by chanting the name of a holy devotee. The pure devotee of the Lord and the Lord Himself are nondifferent. It is sometimes feasible to chant the name of a holy devotee. This is a very sanctified process. Lord Caitanya was once chanting the holy names of the gopīs.

[CC Adi 12.92](https://vedabase.io/en/library/cc/adi/12/92/)
```
  yāṅ-sabā-smaraṇe pāi caitanya-caraṇa
  yāṅ-sabā-smaraṇe haya vāñchita pūraṇa
```
- Simply by remembering the names of all these Vaiṣṇavas, one can attain the lotus feet of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Indeed, simply by remembering their holy names, one achieves the fulfillment of all desires.
