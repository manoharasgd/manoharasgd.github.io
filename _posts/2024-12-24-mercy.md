```
  śrī-bhagavān uvāca
  yasyāham anugṛhṇāmi
  hariṣye tad-dhanaṁ śanaiḥ
  tato ’dhanaṁ tyajanty asya
  svajanā duḥkha-duḥkhitam

  - The Personality of Godhead said: If I especially favor someone, I gradually deprive him of his wealth. Then the relatives and friends of such a poverty-stricken man abandon him. In this way he suffers one distress after another.
  - When he becomes frustrated in his attempts to make money and instead befriends My devotees, I bestow My special mercy upon him.
  - Srila Prabhupada meditated on this sloka when faced with difficulties in his family life
