[SB 3.12.23 purport](https://vedabase.io/en/library/sb/3/12/23/)
  - The very name Nārada suggests that he can deliver the Supreme Lord. Nāra means the “Supreme Lord,” and da means “one who can deliver.”

[CC Madhya 9.30](https://vedabase.io/en/library/cc/madhya/9/30/)
  - “ ‘The word “kṛṣ” is the attractive feature of the Lord’s existence, and “ṇa” means spiritual pleasure. When the verb “kṛṣ” is added to the affix “ṇa,” it becomes “Kṛṣṇa,” which indicates the Absolute Truth.’
  - This is a verse from the Mahābhārata (Udyoga-parva 71.4)
