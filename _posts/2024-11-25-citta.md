[CC Madhya 22.107](https://vedabase.io/en/library/cc/madhya/22/107/)

```
nitya-siddha kṛṣṇa-prema ‘sādhya’ kabhu naya
śravaṇādi-śuddha-citte karaye udaya
```

- citte - in the heart
- “Pure love for Kṛṣṇa is eternally established in the hearts of the living entities. It is not something to be gained from another source. When the heart is purified by hearing and chanting, this love naturally awakens.


[BG 6.20](https://vedabase.io/en/library/bg/6/20-23/)
```
yatroparamate cittaṁ
niruddhaṁ yoga-sevayā
yatra caivātmanātmānaṁ
paśyann ātmani tuṣyati
```
- cittam - mental activities
- In the stage of perfection called trance, or samādhi, one’s mind is completely restrained from material mental activities by practice of yoga. This perfection is characterized by one’s ability to see the Self by the pure mind and to relish and rejoice in the Self.

[BG 10.9](https://vedabase.io/en/library/bg/10/9/)

```
mac-cittā mad-gata-prāṇā
bodhayantaḥ parasparam
kathayantaś ca māṁ nityaṁ
tuṣyanti ca ramanti ca
```
  - mat-cittāḥ — their minds fully engaged in Me
  - The thoughts of My pure devotees dwell in Me, their lives are fully devoted to My service, and they derive great satisfaction and bliss from always enlightening one another and conversing about Me.


[Cit, Citta, manah](https://www.thespiritualscientist.com/is-citta-a-part-of-the-subtle-body/)
  - Cit - original spiritual consciousness (sac cit ananda). analogy - person can see everywhere inside the movie theatre - other people, hall, movie screen etc.
  - Citta - embodied consciousness - original consciousness (energy) routed through the subtle body. It is not part of the subtle body. analogy - once the movie starts, person gets glued to the screen and becomes engrossed in it.

  - [BG 2.17](https://vedabase.io/en/library/bg/2/17/)
  ```
    avināśi tu tad viddhi
    yena sarvam idaṁ tatam
    vināśam avyayasyāsya
    na kaścit kartum arhati
  ```
   - That which pervades the entire body you should know to be indestructible. No one is able to destroy that imperishable soul.
   - each and every body is the embodiment of an individual soul, and the symptom of the soul’s presence is perceived as individual consciousness.

   -  [Mundaka Upanishad 3.1.9](https://vedabase.io/en/library/bg/2/17/)
  ```
  eṣo ’ṇur ātmā cetasā veditavyo
  yasmin prāṇaḥ pañcadhā saṁviveśa
  prāṇaiś cittaṁ sarvam otaṁ prajānāṁ
  yasmin viśuddhe vibhavaty eṣa ātmā
  ```
  - “The soul is atomic in size and can be perceived by perfect intelligence. This atomic soul is floating in the five kinds of air (prāṇa, apāna, vyāna, samāna and udāna), is situated within the heart, and spreads its influence all over the body of the embodied living entities. When the soul is purified from the contamination of the five kinds of material air, its spiritual influence is exhibited.”
  - See also [SB 11.3.38](https://vedabase.io/en/library/sb/11/3/38/) about Prana.
  - [BG 13.7](https://vedabase.io/en/library/bg/13/6-7/) - cetanā — living symptoms
  - Māyā has two potencies with which to execute her two functions — the prakṣepātmikā-śakti, the power to throw the living entity into the ocean of material existence, and āvaraṇātmikā-śakti, the power to cover the knowledge of the living entity. The function of the the āvaraṇātmikā-śakti is explained in the Bhagavad-gītā by the word māyayāpahṛta-jñānāḥ. [CC 7.114 purport](https://vedabase.io/en/library/cc/adi/7/114/)
