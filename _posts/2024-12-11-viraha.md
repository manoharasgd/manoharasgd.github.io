  ```
    mayi bhaktir hi bhūtānām
    amṛtatvāya kalpate
    diṣṭyā yad āsīn mat-sneho
    bhavatīnāṁ mad-āpanaḥ
  ```
  - Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa said: “Devotional service unto Me is the only way to attain Me. My dear gopīs, whatever love and affection you have attained for Me by good fortune is the only reason for My returning to you.”
