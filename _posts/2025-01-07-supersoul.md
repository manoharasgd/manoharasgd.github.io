[BG 10.20](https://vedabase.io/en/library/bg/10/20/)
```
  aham ātmā guḍākeśa
  sarva-bhūtāśaya-sthitaḥ
  aham ādiś ca madhyaṁ ca
  bhūtānām anta eva ca
```
  - I am the Supersoul, O Arjuna, seated in the hearts of all living entities. I am the beginning, the middle and the end of all beings.

[BG 15.15](https://vedabase.io/en/library/bg/15/15/)
```
  sarvasya cāhaṁ hṛdi sanniviṣṭo
  mattaḥ smṛtir jñānam apohanaṁ ca
  vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyo
  vedānta-kṛd veda-vid eva cāham
```
  - I am seated in everyone’s heart, and from Me come remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness. By all the Vedas, I am to be known. Indeed, I am the compiler of Vedānta, and I am the knower of the Vedas.

[BG 18.61](https://vedabase.io/en/library/bg/18/61/)
```
  īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānāṁ
  hṛd-deśe ’rjuna tiṣṭhati
  bhrāmayan sarva-bhūtāni
  yantrārūḍhāni māyayā
```
  - The Supreme Lord is situated in everyone’s heart, O Arjuna, and is directing the wanderings of all living entities, who are seated as on a machine, made of the material energy.
