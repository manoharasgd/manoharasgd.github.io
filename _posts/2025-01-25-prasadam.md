  - Śyāmasundara: He says that he always understood that one should not eat in front of the Deity. What is the difference?
  - Prabhupāda: Difference is generally we should not eat before the Deity. But there is another injunction: prasādaḥ prāptir mātreṇa bhoktavyaḥ. As soon as prasādam comes, you should immediately eat it. All the devotees laughed as Prabhupāda ate the remaining part of his laḍḍu.

[CC Madhya 6.225](https://vedabase.io/en/library/cc/madhya/6/225/)
```
  śuṣkaṁ paryuṣitaṁ vāpi
  nītaṁ vā dūra-deśataḥ
  prāpti-mātreṇa bhoktavyaṁ
  nātra kāla-vicāraṇā
```
  - The Bhaṭṭācārya said, “ ‘One should eat the mahā-prasādam of the Lord immediately upon receiving it, even though it is dried up, stale or brought from a distant country. One should consider neither time nor place.


[CC Madhya 6.226](https://vedabase.io/en/library/cc/madhya/6/225/)
```
  na deśa-niyamas tatra
  na kāla-niyamas tathā
  prāptam annaṁ drutaṁ śiṣṭair
  bhoktavyaṁ harir abravīt
```
  - “ ‘The prasādam of Lord Kṛṣṇa is to be eaten by gentlemen as soon as it is received; there should be no hesitation. There are no regulative principles concerning time and place. This is the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.’ ”
  - These verses are quoted from the Padma Purāṇa.
