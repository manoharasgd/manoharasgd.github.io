[SB 10.14.4 purport](https://vedabase.io/en/library/sb/10/14/4/)
```
  patreṣu puṣpeṣu phaleṣu toyeṣv akrīta-labhyeṣu vadaiva satsu
  bhaktyā su-labhye puruṣe purāṇe muktyai kim arthaṁ kriyate prayatnaḥ
```
  - Since the primeval Personality of Godhead is easily attained by offering Him such things as leaves, flowers, fruits and water, which are all found without difficulty, why does one need to endeavor for liberation separately?

[BG 9.26](https://vedabase.io/en/library/bg/9/26/)
```
  patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyaṁ
  yo me bhaktyā prayacchati
  tad ahaṁ bhakty-upahṛtam
  aśnāmi prayatātmanaḥ
```
  - If one offers Me with love and devotion a leaf, a flower, a fruit or water, I will accept it.
  - Also [SB 10.81.4](https://vedabase.io/en/library/sb/10/81/4/), Lord Krishna addresses Sudama
