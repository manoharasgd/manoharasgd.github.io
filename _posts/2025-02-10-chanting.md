[SB 4.8.53](https://vedabase.io/en/library/sb/4/8/53/) purport,
  - One should not artificially try to see the form of the Lord while chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, but when the chanting is performed offenselessly the Lord will automatically reveal Himself to the view of the chanter. Therefore the chanter has to concentrate on hearing the vibration, and without extra endeavor on his part, the Lord will automatically appear.
