[NOD lecture](https://vanisource.org/wiki/721020_-_Lecture_NOD_-_Vrndavana) - My Guru Mahārāja used to say, ```prāṇa arthe yaṅra sei hetu pracāra```. A preacher can, a person can become a preacher if he has got life. A dead man cannot become a preacher. So you must be very enthusiastic that "I shall preach the glories of the Lord to my best capacity."
