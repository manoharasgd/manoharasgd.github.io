BRS 1.2.27 (SB 3.25.34), Vishvanaatha Cakravarthi thakura's commentary
- The happiness of brahman is thus not pleasing to them because it lacks service to the Lord’s feet; it lacks perception of the beauty of the Lord; and it lacks the taste of the Lord’s sweet pastimes. These are the three reasons why the devotees do not desire liberation.
